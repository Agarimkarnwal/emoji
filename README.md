# 🤙 Clash Royale Real-Life Emote Tool 🤪

Ever wanted to flex your Clash Royale emotes in **real life**—so your friends, family, or hostile rival can see just how sad, happy, or tilted you are?  
Now you CAN: **using your WEBCAM** and your own hands!  
No elixir needed, just pure Python and a dash of meme energy. 🧑‍💻🐸

***

## What Is This?

This project uses your webcam, MediaPipe hand tracking, and randomly flailing your hands near your face to **pop up Clash Royale emotes** on your video.  
You can trigger the *sad goblin* by putting both hands on your cheeks, or show off your *double thumbs-up* for... well, whenever you’re the GOAT.  
**Great for:**
- Roasting friends on Discord
- Spicing up video calls/streams
- Summoning legendary cringe IRL

## Demo

![gif of your face and emote]( imagine: you do *this* 👇  
👐😲 (hands-on-cheeks)  
BAM! ☹️🐸 *Sad Goblin* appears.

***

## How Does It Work?

- Loads your favorite emote images (transparent `.webp`/`.png` like a pro)
- Uses [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) to track hand landmarks
- Watches for:
    - **Both hands on cheeks:** 😢 triggers Goblin Emote (sad hours)
    - **Both thumbs up:** 👍👍 triggers alternative ‘champion’ emote
- Slaps the chosen emote on the middle of your video for everyone to see  
- All 100% in Python with zero pay-to-win!

***

## Features

- **Zero royale pass required** (open source, baby)
- Instant emote reaction when you do the right gesture
- Add more emotes! (just bring your own PNGs and gestures)
- Debug rectangles so you know just where to put those thumbs/fingers
- Supports rage quitting (press ‘q’)

***

## Setup

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Drop your emote images** (e.g., `goblin.webp`, `images.png`) into the project
3. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```
4. **Run it:**
   ```bash
   python emote_tool.py
   ```

***

## Usage

- **Hands on cheeks = Sad Goblin** 😢🐸
- **Double thumbs up = Thumbs Up Emote** 👍👍🥇
- **Want more emotes?** Add your own images + detection rule = infinite flex

***

## Customization

**To add another emote:**
- Bring your favorite transparent `.png` or `.webp`
- Slap it in the folder
- Write a silly gesture check
- Map gesture -> emote; profit 💰

***

## Troubleshooting

- **No emotes appear?**
    - Make sure your webcam is working & you’re not a vampire.
    - Check your emote images exist and the file paths are correct.
- **It never detects my gesture?**
    - Put your hands/fingers in the supplied green debug boxes.
    - Don’t be shy, get close to the camera!  
- **Both emotes at once?**
    - Sorry, only one at a time; this isn’t a Clash Royale tower rush.
